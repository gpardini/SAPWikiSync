====== Performance Analisis DBACockpit ======
Created mi√©rcoles 25 noviembre 2015


===== Use the Performance Overview Monitor on DBACockpit to Check =====
* **The data buffer quality** is based on the ratio of physical reads to the total
number of reads. The lower the ratio, the better the buffer quality. The data
buffer quality should be better than 94,0%; the statistics should be based on
15 million total reads. This number of reads ensures that the database is in a
state of equilibrium.
* Good performance is indicated by a ratio of user and recursive calls that
is greater than 2. Otherwise, the number of recursive calls compared to
the number of user calls is too high. Over time, this ratio always declines
because more and more SQL statements are parsed in the meantime.
* If the number of reads per user call exceeds 30 blocks per user call, this
might indicate an expensive SQL statement.
* Check the value of time/user call. Values larger than 15 ms often indicate
an optimization issue.
* Compare busy wait time versus CPU time. A ratio of 60:40 generally
indicates a well-tuned system. Significantly higher values (for example,
80:20) indicate room for improvement.
* The DD cache quality should be better than 80%

===== Use SUB-Monitors to check SQL Statements =====
sub-monitors in the DBA Cockpit help you analyze SQL statements.

==== Filesystem Requests (Improve disk I/O) ====
Data file activity has an effect on database performance. This view helps you to identify the frequently used data files and put them on separate disks to avoid
contention, if necessary.

==== Lock Monitor (Identify DB Deadlocks) ====
This monitors currently active locks.

==== System Event History (Identify DB actions that might impact performance) ====
Gives you an overview of the history of system events of the Oracle instance(s).
