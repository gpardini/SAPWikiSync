====== DISK SPACE - Clear Logs ======
Created viernes 06 noviembre 2015

Over time, many log files and other intermediate files, such as backups on disks, are created. To clean up these logs, use brconnect -f cleanup. This process cleans:
* Detailed logs of the BR*Tools
* Disk backups created by BRBACKUP and BRARCHIVE
* Export dumps and scripts created by BRSPACE
* Log records and check results in the tables SDBAH, SDBAD, DBA*, and DBMGSGORA
* Oracle trace and audit files
Note: Normally, BRCONNECT is started as follows: 
**brconnect -u -c -f cleanup**
