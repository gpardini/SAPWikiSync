====== TP Return codes ======
Created jueves 26 noviembre 2015

tp receives return codes from all the transport tools involved in an import process.
tp's own return code following exit is interpreted as follows:
* 0 to 16 indicate the maximum value of all return codes from transport tools.
* 17 to 99 are values that are calculated from the return codes of the transport tools and a tp warning, for example, the buffer of the target system has no write permission.
* 100 to 199 indicates warnings. Warnings mean that something went wrong and tp could not perform all the tasks. 100 to 149 are normal tp warnings.
For example, RDDIMPDP cannot be triggered by sapevt. Return codes of 150 to 199 are rare and indicate incorrect operation by a user. For example, a return code of 152 is received if tp tries to import a request that is not included in the buffer.
* 200 or more indicates tp errors. For example, if a file could not be accessed as required by the import process, the return code is 212.
The accompanying text is more significant than the value of a return code. To display the text of a specific tp return code, use the tp command tp explain rc <value of return code>.
